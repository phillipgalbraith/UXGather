## ‚òùÔ∏è **Pitch**

(at times tests are erroneously referred to potlucks to remind to rename data)

If you have ever tried to organize anonymous usability tests with multiple facilitators and participants through expensive complex applications or a multiplatform work flow, you know why this app is essential. 

In the world of usability test organizers, the "UXGather" is king. This is your place for simple qualitative tests.

## ‚úÖ  **MVP**

1. As an `facilitator` I can create an upcoming usability test `potluck` and invite participant to attend

1. As an `facilitator` I can select enter an an upcoming `test` during creation

2. As an `facilitator` I can adjust `date`s, `time`s and `location`s  of the usability test // locations are links to Google Meet or Zoom etc.

3. As an `facilitator` I can use the list feature in my app to add Realistic Actionable Tasks (`items`) - ie "users create a new test" - that we'd like to see in the usability test

4. As a `facilitator` to a usability test I want to be able to confirm that I'm going to the upcoming `potluck` (rebrand usability test)

5. As a `facilitator` I'd like to be able to select which Tasks (`item`s) I'd like to be responsible for mediating.

**NOTE: All of the user stories above should only require a single user type. Users can create "usability tests" and add other users to them.**

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **Stretch**

1. Add a reminders functionality that allows users to link up their upcoming `date`s to their Google calendar.

2. Ability to upload multiple `photos` from the usability test gathering, like a photo gallery of annotated Screenshots from a past test.

3. As an `facilitator` I can use the list feature in my app to add up to 5 test Subject's email adresses `participantEmails`.

4. Create a unique code for each email to enter without logging in to confirm and cancel (boolean) test participant availablity 

6. The app has an endpoint that displays the going status when a code is entered and has a toggle switch with a submit button that goes to confirmation screen.

5. As an `facilitator` I can see each emails' `going` status. `participantEmails`.
